# Recruitment task for Mediport

I've created an asynchronous tags table with the ability to preview the component in Storybook.

## Commands to start project

```bash
npm ci

```

To open Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Technologies

 - React,
 - Vite,
 - TypeScript,
 - Material UI,
 - ReactQuery,
 - Storybook,

## Why ReactQuery

I decided to use ReactQuery, because of its lightweight nature and built-in caching mechanisms, it lets you skip the hassle of handling state in a more complex way in the application.

## Storybook - request mocking

In storybook, data is mocked to avoid unnecessary API calls.

## Required version

node version: 18+, 20+
